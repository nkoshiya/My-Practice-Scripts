The statistical concepts that weâ€™ll cover include:

1. Mean : np.mean(water_height)
2. Median - While the median tells us where half of our data lies, let's look at a value closer to the end of the dataset : np.median(water_height)
3. Percentiles -  We can use percentiles to use a data points position and get its value : np.percentile(water_height, 75)
4. Interquartile Range 
5. Outliers
6. Standard Deviation - Tells us the spread of our data : np.std(water_height)
---------------------
1. NUMPY AND MEAN
# axis 1 - row
# axis 0 - column

1. we can filter through dataset using operators in np.mean(array>value 5) ; output is a percentage of total - dataset
---------------------
2. Outliers & Sorting

np.sort(array) can tell quickly if any outlier exists
--------------------
3. Median Vs. Mean
Mean gets affected by a few outliers
Median represent the middle value meaning which value most of your dataset is at.
